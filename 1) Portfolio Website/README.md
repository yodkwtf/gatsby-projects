# Portfolio Website

A design for a portfolio website built with Gatsby, using Strapi as the headless CMS. We're fetching data from Strapi via Graphql. In addition to this, the website also has an advanced SEO component powered by react-helmet that allows us to have things like social media cards, cover pic, etc.  The pages for all the single projects are created programmatically using the latest file system route API approach.
